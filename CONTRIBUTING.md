## Local development

- This repository does not require a pinned .NET SDK via `global.json`.
- Use an installed .NET SDK compatible with the project target framework (`net8.0`).
- If you choose to pin the SDK locally for your environment, do so outside of this repo or avoid committing `global.json`.
